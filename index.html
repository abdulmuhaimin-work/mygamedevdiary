    <h1>A game dev diary</h1>

    <p>An everyday entry of my progress towards creating my first game and beyond</p>

                <p>5th of June 2020 is the first entry into this barebone game dev diary. I decided to create this to
                    expand my writing and force myself to understand enough to explain game development into the diary.
                    Hey maybe someday I'll be nostalgic when reading this diary.</p>
                <p>At this moment in time, I decided too create a custom game in Dota2. Heres the reason why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Im familiar with Dota2 mechanics. As a starting project I think something familiar will be
                        easier to get into</li>
                    <li>Creating a game using Dota2 workshop tools might be limited, but I think thats a good thing for
                        a beginner like me who know nothing about game dev</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="diary-date">7/6/2020</div>
            <div class="diary-entry">
                <p>At current rate, Im playing games much more than I learn about creating them. Right now I dont have
                    any plan or strategy for learning about game development. So my first strategy is to create a
                    schedule. 7am-9am everyday will be the designated time towards game development. I can still use
                    other time for game dev, but this designated time will purely be for game dev, so that I at least
                    spend 2 hours a day toward my goal. And at the end of the session I will update this diary entry
                </p>

            <div class="diary-entry">Familiarizing with Dota 2 workshop. learned how to modify map, units and abilities
                using Lua. Really need to refer to dota 2 API page alot. the console is a useful place to see whats
                happening.</div>

            <div class="diary-entry">
                <p>learn how to create and modify projectiles. "OnXxxx" is functions that listen to specific event
                    occurence. reference can be found on the dev site.</p>
                <p>To create custom ability, define the properties in npc_custom_abilities.txt. then create a separate
                    .lua file for the custom abilities behaviour.</p>

                <p>still on creating abilites, creating and modifying projectile. and a little crash course course on
                    Lua. The most famous Lua thing is apparently index start with 1.</p>

                <p>VRF - Source 2 resource viewer is a useful piece of software if you want to refer to other Dota 2
                    custom games(.vpk files). Downloaded Dota 2 custom game is located at .. Program Files
                    (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570.. Since the name of the file are just random numbers, you can figure out which is which best on the last updated date. Recently I play Custom Hero Clash
                    alot, so viewing the source code for it made for a better understanding of the game and how its being made
                    created</p>
                <p> On that note I finished watching Pohka dev tutorial. It is very helpful but somehow I still dont know where to start. Am I not motivated enough??</p>

                <p> Ive been looking at fantasy console for the past weeks, specifically Pico-8. Its design choice and limitation might be more enticing for me since I have a hard time figuring out complex games.</p>
                <p> I hope this is the right choice for me. Ive been procastinating alot</p>
